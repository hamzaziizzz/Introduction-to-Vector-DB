WORK EXPERIENCE
Assistant Engineer – AI
Global InfoVentures Pvt. Ltd. | August 2023 – Present
• Led development of 4 commercial-grade Facial Recognition Attendance Systems on DGX A100, RTX
4090, Jetson Orin Nano, achieving >99.99% accuracy
• Developed G6 Voice Assistant, converting natural language voice queries into precise SQL queries via
Rasa, Gemini 2.0, and Milvus Vector DB; handled ambiguous queries with advanced intent
disambiguation, achieving near-100% intent classification accuracy
• Mitigated domain shift by introducing a two-stage vector database (mobile + CCTV), boosting
recognition hit-rate from 85% to 99% in overhead-angle surveillance scenarios
• Engineered high-throughput inference pipeline with batched preprocessing and Milvus (GPU-indexed)
similarity search, boosting face recognition throughput while maintaining <20ms latency per batch
• Integrated PostgreSQL for recognition logs and designed API sync with legacy SIM ERP Portal for
centralized attendance marking and real-time SMS alert system for parents
AI Intern
Global InfoVentures Pvt. Ltd. | February 2023 – July 2023
• Contributed as core developer and internal trainer for AI/ML training batches across CSE, AIML, and
Data Science students, delivering sessions on:
▪ Traditional ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN)
▪ CNN Architectures (VGG, ResNet, InceptionNet)
▪ Hands-on projects in Computer Vision using YOLOv8

PROJECTS
G6 Voice Assistant – Natural Language to SQL Converter
Global InfoVentures Pvt. Ltd.
Built a robust voice-driven assistant capable of interpreting user speech into SQL queries across multiple
institutional modules.
• Integrated SpeechRecognition, Rasa, and Gemini 2.0 to convert user voice input into structured SQL
queries, enabling seamless access to ERP data from modules like Admission, Employee, Fee, and Library.
• Achieved ~100% intent classification accuracy using Rasa by training with 50+ voice query variations
per module. Implemented secondary intent resolution via contextual follow-ups for ambiguous queries
(e.g., "Hamza Aziz" as student or employee)
• Provided Gemini with field-level schema mappings per module and injected Milvus Vector DB-based
field suggestions to reduce hallucinations and improve SQL accuracy
• Designed post-processing and summarization logic to convert SQL output into human-readable, voicebased responses
• Solved heterogeneity in field values (e.g., department/ designation name variations) using vector-based
field and value disambiguation, improving precision in SQL generation by over 40%.
• Planned future versions with fine-tuned open-source LLMs deployed on NVIDIA DGX A100 to reduce
Gemini cost and support cross-module queries without Rasa
Facial Recognition Attendance Systems
Global InfoVentures Pvt. Ltd.
Developed and led deployment of 4 AI-powered attendance systems used by educational institutes and
enterprises:
• CCTV-Based Face Attendance System
▪ Deployed on NVIDIA DGX A100, handled 20+ live CCTV streams using scrfd_10g_gnkps
and w600k_r50 models (TensorRT Optimized)
▪ Used Milvus (vector DB) with dual dataset staging (mobile + CCTV) to mitigate domain shift,
achieving >99.99% accuracy
▪ Integrated with PostgreSQL & legacy SIM Portal ERP via API
• PTZ-Classroom Attendance System
▪ Used rotating PTZ cameras to periodically capture classroom snapshots, process through the
face recognition pipeline, and auto-mark attendance. Helped eliminate roll calls and reduced proxy
attendance by 25%
• Mobile App-Based Attendance System
▪ Created a low-cost variation allowing faculty to upload classroom photos via mobile app,
achieving scalability without PTZ hardware
• Edge-Based Office Attendance System
▪ Deployed on Jetson Orin Nano using DeepStream SDK, Raspberry Pi AI Camera, and proximity
sensors for real-time recognition. Replaced legacy biometric system with contactless AI-driven
attendance tracking
